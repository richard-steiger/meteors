You're tasked with doing a market study for a proposed new product concept.  Thinking you'll get a jump on it, you find a good example of a market study in Word, make a copy of it, remove content to leave just the outline, and save it.  You're off and running!
It turns out that you'll need to do a lot of research, starting with identifying competitive products, and analyzing their features, cost, etc.  You get started by searching the web, and creating a bookmark folder in your favorite browser (let's assume IE for discussion).
At some point, you realize that this project is bigger than you can do on your own within the alloted timeframe, so you discuss this with your supervisor, who assigns a junior staffer to work with you.  
While it's great to have another pair of hands on the project, you immediately realize that you now need to setup a way to share information.  You contemplate just creating a new drive letter on your work directory and share that out, but realize that if your disk crashes, you'll lose all files, so you instead contact a systems administrator to create a share on a centrally-managed server, or create a SharePoint site; the SA promises to get back to you no later than tomorrow morning.
Okay, the share is finally ready, so you migrate your working documents to the share.  Of course, this invalidates the shortcuts to these docs you've put on your desktop, so you'll need to refresh those.  Your next step will be to share your web research, and you realize that you'll somehow need to get your bookmarks to your team-mate, so you dump them out to a file and mail it to your mate or post it on the share and mail them the link.  Of course, once you get back to doing your research, the bookmark folder copy you sent becomes stale, but you're starting to worry that adding a new resource has just set you back a day, so you promise yourself you'll deal with that later….
Okay, we're now finally ready to really get down to work.  
You realize you're going to need to gather data on several products, such as their vendor, pricing, and capacity, so you create a spreadsheet and start to plug in the data.  This won't be useful until you've also collected user features, so you add columns to the spreadsheet to code the features as properties.  As you review successive products, you discover additional features, for which you add new columns to the spreadsheet.  Within a day, the sheet now has over two dozen columns, and the sheet becomes increasingly unwieldy, your productivity starts to lag.  
Meanwhile, your teammate has been doing analysis on other products, and collecting the data in her own copy of the spreadsheet.  You check-in with each other in a day, and discover that both of your sheets have dozens of columns, which don't line up between the sheets, since each of you has used distinct terminology for similar features.  Worse, you used Y/N to indicate presence/absence of a feature, and she's used 0-5 to rate the extent the feature is provided.  After working together for 5 hours, you've got your sheets merged into a single sheet, but the going's been especially slow because you spend most of your time scrolling around the two sheets.
You also can't effectively cut sections from the sheet on her laptop, and paste them into the sheet on your desktop, so you instead had to load her sheet into a separate page in your workbook and constantly flip between pages.
