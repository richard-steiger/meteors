You're tasked with doing a market study for a proposed new product concept.  Thinking you'll get a jump on it, you find a good example of a market study in Word, make a copy of it, remove content to leave just the outline, and save it.  You're off and running!
<p>
It turns out that you'll need to do a lot of research, starting with identifying competitive products, and analyzing their features, cost, etc.  You get started by searching the web, and creating a bookmark folder in your favorite browser (let's assume IE for discussion).
<p>
At some point, you realize that this project is bigger than you can do on your own within the alloted timeframe, so you discuss this with your supervisor, who assigns a junior staffer to work with you.  
<p>
While it's great to have another pair of hands on the project, you immediately realize that you now need to setup a way to share information.  You contemplate just creating a new drive letter on your work directory and share that out, but realize that if your disk crashes, you'll lose all files, so you instead contact a systems administrator to create a share on a centrally-managed server, or create a SharePoint site; the SA promises to get back to you no later than tomorrow morning.
<p>
Okay, the share is finally ready, so you migrate your working documents to the share.  Of course, this invalidates the shortcuts to these docs you've put on your desktop, so you'll need to refresh those.  Your next step will be to share your web research, and you realize that you'll somehow need to get your bookmarks to your team-mate, so you dump them out to a file and mail it to your mate or post it on the share and mail them the link.  Of course, once you get back to doing your research, the bookmark folder copy you sent becomes stale, but you're starting to worry that adding a new resource has just set you back a day, so you promise yourself you'll deal with that later….
